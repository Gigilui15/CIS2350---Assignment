# CIS2350---Assignment
MLP to learn the 5-input XOR problem (Without using ML Libraries)

'XORProblem.py' is a script of the 'Assignment' MLP which had the following requirements:

Implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the 5-input XOR problem.
The model is built as demonstrated in class.
You must implement the project in Python without using AI and ML libraries such as Keras.
Use a (random) 80/20 training/test split.
Use sigmoid for the hidden and output layer neurons.
Use a single output for the class label (0 to 1).
Your MLP must therefore have 5 input and 1 output neurons.
Start with 4 hidden layer neurons and then experiment with different values.
Express results as simple classification error.
Discuss, and interpret, the results.
Extras - what other experiments, or visualizations, can you do?
You do not need a GPU to train the network.

'EpochsVsBadFacts.py' is a script run after the model is trained to obtain a csv file with the total number of bad facts for each epoch. This is run to eventually plot the Bad Facts Vs Epochs Graph

The other scripts 'XORProblem - 2 Hidden Layers.py' and 'XORProblem - 3 Hidden Layers.py' are the same MLP but with additional hidden layers which were experimented with for this project.
